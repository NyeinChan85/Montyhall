Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    The Monty Hall problem emulates a scenario inspired by the TV show "Let's Make a Deal" with the host named Monty Hall.
    It involves three doors, one hiding a car and the other two concealing goats. The contestant initially chooses one door, 
    after which the host reveals a goat behind one of the remaining doors. The contestant is then presented with an option: 
    stick with their original selection or switch to the unopened door.To explore and analyze both strategies, 
    this simulation was developed.
